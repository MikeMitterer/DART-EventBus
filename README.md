This little sample provides you with an <strong>EventBus</strong> for Dart.

Download the sample, start "Dart Editor", run the HTML-File and open the consol-window in Chromium.

Hope this helps someone.

If you ask yourself what the f*** is Dart - then click [[dartlang]](http://www.dartlang.org/) for
